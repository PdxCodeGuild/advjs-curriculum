# Javascript Koans

Go to [javascript-koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans) and complete all the exercises.

## Extra credit

In the final koan, AboutApplyingWhatWeHaveLearnt.js, you are asked to use some of the underscore library utility functions, such as map, chain, filter, and reduce.

However, javascript has since added enough utility functions to the array prototype that these are no longer necessary.

### Your task

Rewrite all your code in AboutApplyingWhatWeHaveLearnt.js to use javascript's native functions instead of unerscore functions.

Take a look at the [Array docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#) to see what methods are available.

Try using the following:

- [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
- [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
- [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
- [flat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat)
- [flatMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flatMap)

Talk to your instructor if you finish this with time to spare...
