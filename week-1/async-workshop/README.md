# Async Workshop

This workshop has you implement various asynchronous utility functions.

To complete the workshop, simply fill out the functions in `src/async.js` such that the tests in `spec/async-spec.js` all pass.

You may have CORS issues when trying to run the specs. To get around this, you need to create a server that can serve the files.

In the root directory of the project run one of the following commands:

For python 2, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

For python 3, run `python -m http.server`

Now in your browser, go to `http://localhost:8000/SpecRunner.html?random=false` to run the tests.

Note, your python server may use a different port, for example port 8080 instead of 8000. Adjust the url above so it uses the correct port.
