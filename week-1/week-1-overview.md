# Week 1 - Javascript Crash Course

Week 1 is all about getting up to speed with important aspects of javascript which are necessary for the rest of the course.

The most important feature of javascript, by far, is the [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)).

But to understand closures, we must first understand higher order functions.

After that we will learn about the second most important aspect of javascript: the asyncronous programming model, and how it differs from synchronous programming.

Understanding these concepts will be foundational for everything else we do in this course.

## Rough outline

### Day 1

* Set expectations + intro to course lecture
* Activity: [Javascript Koans](./koans.md)


### Day 2

* higher order functions
* introduce lodash and the idea of utility libraries
* Activity: [Building a Utility Belt](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/bat-belt)

### Day 3

* Closures
* Crockford Function Challenges
  * See [function challenge spec file](./function-challenge-spec.js)

### Day 4

* Continue Crockford Function Challenges if we didn't finish on Day 3
* If we finish with time to spare
  * Lecture on trees and recursion
  * Activity: 
    * implement DOM traversal methods from scratch
    * implement JSON.stringify and JSON.parse from scratch

### Day 5

* Async
  * what is it
  * examples
  * the "event loop" explained
* Activity: [Async Tool-Belt](./async-utility.md)
