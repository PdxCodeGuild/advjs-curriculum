# Interview Problems

See [whiteboard problems](./whiteboard-problems) for coding questions.

These questions here are more in the "phone screen" category.

When practicing these, don't depend on writing code to explain your answer, but rather try to explain the concepts with a clear and simple answer.

Sometimes these types of conceptual questions can lead to a more conversational style of interview, where there will be some back and forth based on your responses. Other times the interviewer will keep a tight schedule and will move from one question to the next fairly rapidly, without following up much on your answers.

Either way, prepare for both styles by reviewing these questions and practicing simple and confident delivery.

## Javascript

* What is a closure?

## React

* What is the difference between state and props?
* Why do we use `setState` instead of just updating the state directly?

## Security

* What is a XSS (cross site scripting) attack?
* What is a CSRF (cross site request forgery)?
* What is a JWT (JSON web token)?
