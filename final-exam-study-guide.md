* use `fetch` to send http requests to your server from your react app
* demonstrate knowledge of state and props in react

## Helpful Hints

Much of the exam will be based off things we have done throughout the various phases of the chat app. Don't just study the latest version from weeks 7 & 8, but also check out previous versions as well, such as the file I/O stuff before we used mongo.
