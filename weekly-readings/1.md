[Ted Nelsonâ€™s Computers for Cynics (2012)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdnGPQaICjk)

I've linked to the first one, but he has more videos in this series. Feel free to watch as many as you want.

## Study Questions

* Who is Ted Nelson? What is his contribution to the field? 
* Do you think technologies succeed based more on technological merit or on politics?
  * can you think of an example of a technology that "won" due to its superior technical properties?
  * can you think of an example of a technology that "won" despite being technically inferior to its competitors?
* Look into Ted Nelson's "Xanadu" hypertext system. How does it compare to Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web?
