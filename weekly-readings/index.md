# Weekly Readings

Each week I will assign a reading (sometimes video) to be discussed on the following Monday.

I may also provide some research questions to help provide additional context, or questions to spark certain insights.

**Note: These readings are optional**. I cannot require you to do work on the weekends outside of class time.

## Note on the readings

The purpose of the readings is to build context, and to help the bootcamp grad "catch up" in regards to where the industry is going, where it has been, etc. In a typical 4-year degree program, you pick up on a lot of these things, especially when you have old and wise professors who worked in the industry longer than you've been alive. These readings should help bridge that gap, and hopefully approximate the kind of advice I've picked up on so far in my journey.

Due to the sheer technical nature of our weekly labs, I'd like to keep our readings light and less technical. Many of them will be more on the philosophical side, or at least agnostic regarding current trends in tech. None of them will be about javascipt.
