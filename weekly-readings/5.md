Nancy Leveson's [The Therac-25: 30 Years Later (2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8102762)

## Discussion Questions

* What are some ways of designing a user interface to minimize user errors?
* How is software reuse potentially dangerous?
* Brainstorm some ways that Javascript could be made more safe
* Do you think government oversight and standards is a good idea for safety-critical software?
  * some people are scared that regulation could be too stifling, an example is some people are scared that regulation will lead to a list of what programming languages are legal to use
    * although others think this would be a good thing! Some say using a language that lacks basic saftey checks should be a punishable offense. Consider how in other professions (engineering, medicine, etc.) there are regulations in place, malpractice, etc. to prevent such irresponsible decisions
      * many people gasped in horrer when it was discovered that NASA used javascript to create some of their user interfaces inside a recent space shuttle
