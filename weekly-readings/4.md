# Weekly Reading - Week 4

Tony Hoare's [The Emperor's old clothes (1980)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP4610/hoare.pdf)

## Discussion Questions

* how do you think Tony Hoare would feel about the modern web ecosystem? Consider the languages, tools, etc. as well as npm and the culture around web development

* do you agree with Hoare that we should compromise on objectives in order to keep things simple? Or do you think simplicity is impossible with modern projects, and so we must accept that no single person will understand the system in its entirety?

* Hoare said "If our basic tool, the language in which we design and code our programs, is also complicated, the language itself becomes part of the problem rather than part of its solution."
  * do you think Javascript is part of the problem or part of the solution?
