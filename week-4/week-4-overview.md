# Week 4 - Backend Frameworks (Express)

In this section of the course we take advantage of the Express framework to rewrite our backend in a much simpler way.

After that, we will learn about web sockets and how they can be used to help us create an event-driven arcitecture (instead of having clients constantly polling for new messages).

## Note

This week is a little lighter than previous weeks, so I expect people will finish some activities with time to spare. This is mostly because I wanted to give people extra time to catch up on last week's project, as well as to ensure that we would finish all of this week's tasks.

Let me know if you finish a task early so I help you figure out the next highest priority task to work on.
