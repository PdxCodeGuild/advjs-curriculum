# Chat Room - Phase 4

In this phase of the project, we will refactor our old chatroom server to use React on the fronted.

## Requirements

* Completely replace yo-yo with React
* Use JSX
* The backend should not have to change, other than the build system
* Choice of build system is up to you:
  * browserify (babelify), webpack, maybe even create-react-app
    * although I'm skeptical to recommend create-react-app since it seems overkill in this situation
