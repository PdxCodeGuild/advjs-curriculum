# Chat Room - Phase 4

In this phase of the project, we will refactor our old chatroom server to use React on the fronted.

## Requirements

* Completely replace yo-yo with React
* Use JSX
* The backend should not have to change, other than the build system
* Use create-react-app to generate the starter files, compile the JSX, and bundle the modules
