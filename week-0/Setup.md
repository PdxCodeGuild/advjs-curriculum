## Setup Checklist

- Send me an email so I have your email address
- Create a Slack account (I'll send you an invite)
- Install Node, NPM
- Install VSCode (or program of choice)


## Slack

Please send an email to `zack@pdxcodeguild.com`, so I have your email address. I'll then send you an invitation to Slack. Slack is an instant-messaging app we'll use to communicate. You can install the Slack desktop app rather than use a browser tab if that's easier for you.


## Version Control: Git & GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a popular VCS (version control system) we'll use in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will help us keep track of our source code, and give us a public place to show our work to others, like a programming portfolio. A repository is a collection of folders and files. GitHub hosts a copy of those files, and Git allows us to keep our local and remote repository synchronized.

Download and install Git and create a GitHub account.

## NodeJS & NPM

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) a scripting language based on Chrome's V8 engine and allows you to use Javascript on the server side.

You may get an error that says you don't have access to install modules globally! We'll show how to solve this problem if this happens.

## VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular text editor / extensible IDE used primarily for Javascript/Typescript development. It's written using electron and has a huge collection of plugins and themes. It ships with a set of tools to stream line development including code completion, module resolution, etc.

**It's strongly suggested you use VSCode since the instructor will be using that throughout the course. It will make it easier to follow along / learn neat tricks and tips.**

## Other Text Editors and IDEs

There are a ton of other editors and IDEs out there. You can use something else if you really want to, but just be warned that the instructor is under no obligation to help you troubleshoot other editors/IDEs.
