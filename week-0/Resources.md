## Books and Guides


- [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) - This is the book I read many years ago to learn javascript. I recommend it.

- [Flavicope's Guides](https://flaviocopes.com/page/ebooks/). Previous instructor of the course highly recommends these books. I've never read them so I have no opinion on them.
