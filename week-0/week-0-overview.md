# Week 0

"Week 0" refers to "stuff to do before the course starts". The docs in this folder contain helpful info about the course, or prerequisite material that might be useful to look over.

- Read [CLI.md](./CLI.md) to make sure you are comfortable on the command line.
- [Roles & Responsibilities](./Roles-and-Responsibilities.md)
- Check out [Version Control](./Version-Control.md) to make sure you are comfortable with git
- [Resources](./Resources.md) contains some useful links
- [Regular Expressions](./regular-expressions.md) are super useful to know
