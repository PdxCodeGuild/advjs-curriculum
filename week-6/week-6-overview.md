# Single Page Applications (Routing + More React)

This section of the course serves two purposes. The first is to learn about routing for single page applications (SPAs), which is (along with AJAX) the backbone of modern web apps. Routing, combined with a dynamic framework like React, allows an application to appear to be navigating across multiple pages, without ever having to refresh the page. In reality, the app never actually leaves "the page", but rather it is all happening from within a single page (hence "single page application").

The second purpose of this week is to gain additional practice with React in general.
