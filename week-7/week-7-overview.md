# Mongodb + Putting It All Together (MERN Stack)

In this section of the course we learn the final piece of the MERN stack: MongoDB. Mongo is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like objects, and is queried using javascript (as opposed to SQL).

This week we will also learn about authentication and authorization. This will allow us to add a user system to the chat app.
