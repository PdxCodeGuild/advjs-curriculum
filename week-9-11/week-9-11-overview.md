# Capstone + Misc. Topics

## Week 9

### Pick a project

* Meet with groups and decide on capstone project
  * everyone should put at least a few ideas on the table
  * after everyone as put forth some ideas, discuss the options together and vote on what you want to do

### Intro to Scrum and Agile

Early on this week there will be a lecture on Scrum, Agile, and workflow methodologies. [Link to slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PTsVK6mFDWiOsRlo8DDm-mUMlqTDkExH3YGMnCjKodI/edit?usp=sharing).

* Decide how to break the team into roles
  * 1 Product owner
  * 1 Scrum Master
  * N Developers
    * the PO and SM will still write code as well
* Keep in mind this is a role playing exercise for the sake of learning
  * Everyone has to play along for it to work well

### Design the Project

Before diving into writing code, talk with your team and design mockups/wireframes. Answer questions like "what happens when a user does X?". To help you with this, write some "user stories" for all the major features.

Additionally, research technologies you may need and plan out the software architecture. 

### Deliverables for week 9:

Although writing code should be delayed a bit so you can better plan your project, it is sometimes useful to play around with libraries, APIs, ideas, etc. to prototype so you can gain an understanding if something is feasible, or to gain more understanding about what is required. At least some time should be spent this week on exploratory coding (at least one person).

That being said, here is what is required to "turn in" this week:

1. A decided upon project
2. An agreed upon workflow (github flow, etc.)
3. Assigned Scrum roles
4. Mockups, detailed product requirements, user stories
5. Software Architecture / System Design (diagrams, tech stack, etc.)

## Week 10

Try to finish all core features by the end of the week.

## Week 11

* Clean up projects
  * get into a presentable state
  * fix bugs
  * make a good readme on github
  * any other clean up / polishing
* Deploy
  * really test your deployed version as well, make sure there aren't any bugs that appear in production
* Presentations
