## Further Reading

If you like this sort of thing, there is a whole sub-field called "Devops" and "Site Reliability Engineering" to look into. [Google puts out some great free books](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) on this topic. I read "Site Reliability Engineering" in particular and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this side of the computing industry (also just a fascinating peek into how Google operates).

Also check out articles on [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/all-time-favorites/) where you can learn a lot about the production environments and deployment process of various companies/products.
